Readme for developers

After you pull, run `npm install` to make sure you have all of the dependencies in your directory. (The actual dependencies aren't put on GitHub because they would take forever to push and pull, but they're described in package.json)

Commands:
- `npm run build`: First checks the code against the linter to make sure it's up to style / standard. Then compiles the code so that the website can use it. **The command you'll want to use most often.**
- `npm run compile-ts`: First checks the code against the linter to make sure it's up to style / standard. Then compiles the code so that it can be run locally using node. Useful for checking / testing TypeScript files.
